Project for Distributed Applications Class

We will be using java on the backend to connect to payara glassfish server running on AWS aswell as a MySQL database running on AWS.

The front end will be jquery, javascript, and chartJs to visualize the inventory data. 

Requirements:
Here are some questions and information I provided for a previous team. Let me know if you have any additional questions.

who are the users? – staff of CFL

can you send us some pictures for designs you would like to see? – I honestly I have no idea where to even start with creating an inventory system so I do not have any ideas in mind.

what devices would you like it to be compatible with? – we are open to device recommendations but do not currently have any devices we are using other than our PC’s.

Do you have a preffered color scheme? – Gray and green. Check out our website to see our brand colors.

Would it be possible to get a sample of the spread sheet so we know what variables we might need? – see attached. We do manual counts of our inventory and this use this spreadsheet to help us calculate how much w need to order /  track how much has been used previously

Do you want an universal inventory or an inventory per location? – currently all our inventory is housed in our office so I would imagine universal?
